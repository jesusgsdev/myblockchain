# My Blockchain

The current implementation of the Blockchain in Java allows:

- Initialize the current blockchain giving back a wallet with coins
- Create wallets
- Get wallet's balance
- Send money between wallets

## Helper

I added a postman collection to make easier to perform the different operations on the
endpoints created.
